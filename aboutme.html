                I'm Laurie, a short, 5'0, sarcastic, and snarky nerd. I'm constantly worried about my life and make self-deprecating jokes and jokingly insult others, so sorry if I offend you.

                I spend way too much time on the interwebs and/or obsessing over various TV shows and YouTubers. Yikes, I'm such a cringey teenager. Anyways, below are what I am interested in as of September 2018, including various hobbies and stuff.
               (It's not a very long list since I'm really lazy and don't want to continue thinking of what a lame fangirl I am.)
