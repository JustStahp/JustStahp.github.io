                    <h1> Tips for Elementary (sort of) / Middle / High School! </h1>
                    <body> 
                    <h3>
                    Elementary School:
                    <br> </br>
                    You're fine just the way you are! Be cute and innocent, just live out your life! Don't draw on the furniture, though!
                    <br> </br>
                    Middle School:
                    <br> </br>
                    Please don't think you're better than anyone else or that you're cool depending on what you think is cool. 
                    Newsflash, you're not. Don't be a butt to your friends, parents, or teachers. It'll hurt you in the long run, and you'll look back on yourself like, "Why the frick was I like this?"
                    I know, middle school sucks, but it'll prepare you for the intimidating years of high school.
                    <br> </br>
                    High School:
                    <br> </br>
                    Take it easy, but don't take it too easy. Just do your homework every night, and don't stop until you've finished it. 
                    TRUST ME. You'll get sidetracked forever. Don't Snapchat or Instagram between each problem or each sentence you read.
                    You'll end up finishing at 1:00 AM or give up. DON'T DO THAT. Eat all your meals and don't skip, and study for tests a week in advance!
                    You may see this now and dismiss it, but come on, dude. I know this from experience. And I know you may start hating yourself for being a failure or not living up to expectations.
                    Don't think you're alone. We've all been through that feeling. Power through it, high school is when you start to find your calling and really know what to do with life.
                    The people you associate yourself with may make you feel like garbage and you might feel miserable, but just get out of that and hang out with other friends or yourself a few days a week until it boils over or just cut yourself off completely.
                    I believe in your success, and I know you can do it!
